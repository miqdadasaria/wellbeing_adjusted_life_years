# Wellbeing Adjusted Life Years

This is a R Shiny App to show how wellbeing adjusted life years work.

The basic concept is that wellbeing is a function of health and income.

Full details of the underpinning equations are found in the code and are discussed extensively in a forthcoming book chapter titled "Wellbeing QALYs for Economic Evaluation: Measuring Years of Good Life Gained Based on Consumption, Health and Longevity" full reference details will be posted once the chapter is published.

To run the shiny app from R you must have the shiny package installed and run the following command from the R console: shiny::runGitHub('wellbeing_adjusted_life_years', 'miqdadasaria')

Alternatively a running example can be found at the following address: https://miqdadasaria.shinyapps.io/wellbeing_adjusted_life_years/
